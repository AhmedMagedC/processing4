X can we compress jdk/Contents/Home/legal into a single zip?
X   it's ~300 files of the ~500 in the entire jdk directory
X   working on macOS, written up for Windows and Linux
X   test on Windows and Linux
X working on an updated welcome screen
X fix usages of .array() method in PDE code
X default naming selection not being set in prefs window
X make sure mono font is coming from languages file when first setting editor pref
X fix the processing.foundation cert
X remove links to old pages from the language translations
X   cd build/shared/lib/languages
X   grep menu.help * | grep url

themes
X try gradients in Lab space
X   not an obvious win, so set as a pref and come back to it later
X updateTheme() in Theme Selector not updating color for dropdown on changes
X   theme_selector.combo_box.enabled.bgcolor
X   theme_selector.combo_box.enabled.bgcolor
X   doesn't update dynamically unless you (a) select ‘Minerals’ or ‘Alloys’
X   or (b) open, then close the dropdown
X changing between themes not updating the combo box text (though arrow trigger works)
X   switching between alloys and minerals will properly update
X rollover color for console scrollbar is always blue
X   probably a typo in the theme generator (yep)

export
X if error in the code during export, was just saying "error during export"
X   now sending the error to the status bar as expected
X get code signing to work again on macOS for exported applications
X   absolutely floored that it was broken this long
X   new docs added, window text redone
X "include Java for macOS" only relevant for current macOS platform
X   better to fix that, or make it possible to download both?
X Export to Application on Apple Silicon is including a broken "Universal" appbundler
X   need to lipo a new appbundler, or have it export one of the two files
X rewrote Exporting Applications wiki page
X   include more details about Gatekeeper et al
X “Array_Test.app” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4214 (closed)
X   figure out if we can do anything with signing applications

docs
X update theme instructions
X   https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Themes
X update the platforms page
X   https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Supported-Platforms
o   rename to 'platforms'?
X examples still coming from processing-docs repo
X   https://github.com/processing/processing-examples
X   can safely clone this repo instead of using processing-docs
X 'chars' array is never used in ascii video example
X   https://github.com/processing/processing-video/blob/master/examples/Capture/AsciiVideo/AsciiVideo.pde
X add wiki page for preferences and customization
o auto-complete not auto-triggering, change pref for handling?
o   Auto-completion: [ ] Disabled  [ ] Show on Ctrl-Space  [ ] Always show
o   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5691
X docs about settings.path and sketchbook.path.four
X   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/362
X   https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Preferences#sketchbook-and-settings-location
X add a version of the Troubleshooting page to the 4.x repo
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/troubleshooting
X   and update the Help menu to link to it
X add a version of the FAQ to the processing4 wiki
X   and link to it from the Help menu
X rewrite https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/FAQ for 4.0
X rename changes.md to revisions.md
X   this document replaced revisions.txt, and the name was changed to changes.md
X   to prevent confusion with the old revisions.txt file
X   however, it's far more confusion, because "changes" is used on the  wiki
X   which documents the differences between 3.x and 4.x et al
X other projects on which p5 is built
X   no longer oro matcher and jikes
X   add: quaqua, jna, registry stuff, .. ?
X i can't fix these:
An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:
# EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
all i can do is find things that might trigger them, but it's more likely
than not to be a java problem, and not something that can be fixed
X search the source for 'applet' references (i.e. SVG docs)

housekeeping
X make sure the numbers scripts are working again before launch
o   anything else we need to be tracking?

temp
X temp folders (particularly on Windows)
X   a whole section down below about this
X inside Sketch, makeTempFolder() would be the place to modify the location
X   perhaps make a 'temp' inside the sketchbook folder?
X   on startup, check to see if there are a lot of files, remove them?
X   or maybe auto-delete once older than 24 hours?
X   also don't search it when walking the sketchbook
X untitled folders are stored in temp folder
o add a note about temp dir to the bug on windows temp dirs
o   move away from using a temp dir at all for sketches
o   -Djava.io.tmpdir=Z:\temp
o change up how temp directories are handled
o   it's sometimes copying the files to a different drive on windows
X clean up /tmp folders used during build
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1896 (moved)
X   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/529
X use Platform.delete() to remove untitled sketches
X   would allow us to use the /tmp folder

cleaning
X the gradient.top and gradient.bottom lines are used by makeGradient(),
X   so search for makeGradient() calls to see whether they're still in use.
X   having brought back some gradient themes for beta 9, we'll keep this in place
X create default tools folder (just like libraries)
o for tools, maybe don't run on event thread? (makes the gui hang)
o   but instead, things that affect gui need to be called w/ invokeLater?
X Export to Application was broken with OpenGL (Casey)
X   verified to be working
o show warnings about wrong library folder layout?
X   nah, too fussy to get this to work; spend time on library dev help instead
o check into offscreen text rendering with JNA
o   even just for tab names it'd be so much nicer
o   https://github.com/iterate-ch/rococoa
X   looking good enough for now
o Pasting text into PDE results in "Clipboard does not contain a string"
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3651
X   this was just a workaround, not a fix
X     https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4040
X   closing in the hope that it's resolved in Java 17
X Icon instead of an "X" for the "could not connect" message
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3706
X   done back in 3.0.2
X change to using Platform.delete() instead of Base.removeDir() where possible
X   verify that the OS X version uses the real call
X   and doesn't just look for .Trash
o move old Google Code SVN back to processing.org
o   then cull out the old branches/tags from the Github repo
o   and/or start bundling separate source downloads
X   managed to merge in what was necessary
o getCoreLibrary() is breaking OpenGL
o   "new Library()" constructor needs to go back to private
X   this is ancient
o add .bat file to lib on windows so that we can get better debugging info
o add a Tool for removing extended attributes? xattr -cr /path/to/Something.app
o   when exporting an app, run xattr on it to handle "app is damaged" errors?
o   xattr -cr /path/to/application.app
o   -c removes attributes, -r is recursive
o   doesn't help b/c it has to be done on the receiving end
o what to double-click when opening p5 projects (.pdp?)
o   lack of a project file makes this a little bit of a headache
o   dropping a sketch folder onto the PDE should also be implemented
X   not necessary, and we have sketch.properties
o add documentation for how to run mode development from Eclipse
o   implementation/changes from JDF
o get rid of static mode? only setup/draw mode? or create project that way?
o   pro: simplify internal code, fixes some of the worst errors
o   con: people love it, most of the books use it heavily
o add === for String.equals()
o   might be problematic since it might be opposite the javascript meaning
o   jer: it's a decent time to start talking abt references/vars
o automatic import of JavaFX when FX2D is specified (no time)
o allow modes to specify their own base file name
o   need to move "is this a sketch?" handling into Mode
o createPreprocessor() added to JavaEditor, creating a mess
o   https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/2ecdc36ac7c680eb36e271d17ad80b657b3ae6a0
o break out Mode-specific options to their own panels in prefs
o   Mode should just provide a panel for their prefs
X   skipping this for 4: just not enough options in other Modes
X   and too much overlap with options that would be used across
X   at the end of the day, too confusing
X make the build fail if git pull on processing-docs fails
X remove "save before running" message
o patch to core classpath by Manindra?
o remove toolbar menu references and code to rebuild
o fix single instance server on OS X to load double-clicked files
o   when run from Eclipse, the single instance thing punts
X 'recent' menu needs to recognize the p5 app folder
X   also should recognize the user's home dir
o possibility of libraries folder inside a particular sketch?
o add font fixes to the rest of the API
o   https://github.com/processing/processing/commit/eaff673d173b2d27f276cf5c59e3abf6c0fab86b
o   g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_FRACTIONALMETRICS,
o                       RenderingHints.VALUE_FRACTIONALMETRICS_ON);
o look through all isPopupTrigger() code
o   make sure both press/release are implemented
X add minimum version required (or max version?) to libraries/modes/etc
o reas: code coloring sometimes disappears
X   haven't seen this for a while
o PreferencesFrame is a misnomer (not a frame itself)
o   change to PreferencesDialog, and make it a dialog?
X   nah, it contains a Frame instance; no big deal
o different design of squiggly line
o   easy to do inside JavaTextAreaPainter.paintSquiggle()
X build custom scroll bar since the OS versions are so ugly
X see notes in the 'dialogs' section below, implement our own option panes?
/ tiny trail of dots when moving the selection bar up/down on retina
X   should be resolved
X need 'actively pressed' version of 'play' and 'stop'
X   could do rollover as well, but do other apps use them?
o   iTunes has no rollover state but has a 'down' state
o     swaps to stop after release
o recent menu gets huge with other p5 versions on osx
X spacing of the updates number/circle in the lower right is off
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4094
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4097
o   solution is to create a sprite sheet as a psd that'll have better type
o     no way we're gonna fix the sizing and spacing for all platforms
o     more than a certain amount should just be 10+, +, or whatever
X   resolved earlier
X me: undo not in the correct location
X   this should be resolved elsewhere
o if the lib folder goes missing from export, give an error
o   also any .jar files that are missing, give an error
o   showing more debug messages (command line?)
o when exporting to application (or applet) don't copy .java files from folder
o   (they'll be copied as source files later)
o   make .java files and friends go to correct locations on export (app)
o warn on export when people call their sketches things like Server
o warn if someone extends PApplet but mis-names the sketch
o   or don't allow it to be exported
o   add bug reference to the faq once added to the db
X   or at least add a note about this to the faq
o show error when no main() is included but class extends PApplet
o   error can happen or be checked
o exporting application copies .java files
o   .java files are copied to the root folder as well as the source folder
o two-tiered dialogs for everything - use big font/little font style throughout
o   http://javagraphics.blogspot.com/2008/06/joptionpane-making-alternative.html
X   doesn't work as well (and is less necessary) with FlatLaf
o use macosx dialogs for all of the editor stuff
o   see about doing the same on windows, linux?
o   the others seem to respond ok to the lucida grande since they use defaults
X   switched to FlatLaf
o vista style dialogs
o   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb328626.aspx
X   switched to FlatLaf
o confirmation dialogs (save and don't save.. who'd a thunk it)

o   http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/Aa511273.Confirmations03(en-us,MSDN.10).png
X Tooltip over variable decl has wrong style and content
X   make all tooltips run through our style
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3940
X   done back in 3.x
X Library path mismatch between processing-java and export
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4493
X   duplicate of https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/188
o need to deal with classpath conflicts
o   avoid garbage that people have installed on their machines
o   antlr.jar in the classpath will cause trouble..
o     https://forum.processing.org/beta/num_1138652326.html
o   jogl jar files, or jogl install will cause trouble
o     /System/Library/Java/Extensions or /Library/Java/Extensions
o     the /System one contains qtjava
o     the /Library one is empty (by default), maybe skip it?
X   these should be long fixed
o classpath conflicts also problem with PDE itself
o   catch antlr conflicts, and put up an error message
o   https://download.processing.org/bugzilla/1225.html (no Google issue)
X   also should be long since fixed
o java.ext.dirs for /System/Library/Java/Extensions
o   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/extensions/spec.html
o   can set java.ext.dirs to something else
o   on osx, just ignore anything in /Library/Java/Extensions (but not others)?
X   removed after Java 8: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/migrate/migrating-jdk-8-later-jdk-releases.html#GUID-2C896CA8-927C-4381-A737-B1D81D964B7B
o native lib stuff, use native.txt in lib folder, then:
o   String osName = System.getProperty("os.name");
o   String osArch = System.getProperty("os.arch");
o   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1611357/how-to-make-a-jar-file-that-include-dll-files
o need better error messages for broken api / library troubles
o   e.g. ocd is broken in 0125 because of method signature changes
o make sure there aren't library jar files named the same thing
o   i.e. if one library has db.jar, then that's gonna kill another db.jar
o   when the files are copied over
X   other issues filed for this
X manager huh
X   highlight color seems to be incorrect?
o   after installing, the item in the manager list doesn't change color
o 'recent' menu doesn't respect examples folder of other p5 versions
o   could write that into the file, that it's an example
o   or write the path as shown in the PDE to the file as simpler
X   oh well; want folks using the latest anyway

fonts
X fonts are still really ugly (on non-retina)
o   may need to drop use of Source Sans
o   what do these do, and are we doing it already?
o   System.setProperty("awt.useSystemAAFontSettings","on");
o   System.setProperty("swing.aatext", "true");
X how are we going to handle fonts for other languages?
X   two new fonts have been added, other languages will need more
X   need a decent sans with with Unicode coverage
X   i.e. https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3025
o Implement fallback fonts so we can use Source et al with CJK/Greek/Arabic
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5023

movie maker
o break Movie Maker out to its own library?
o   another big leap in file size reduction for the PDE download
o   nope, spend the time doing auto-download for the binaries
o   would need to figure out a good way to highlight it/encourage installation
o   ...as well as the other libraries? separate window?
X versions for aarch64 as well
X   https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static/releases
X ffmpeg binaries for all our platforms
X   native version for ARM on macOS, also versions for Raspberry Pi
X updated ffmpeg to 5.0.1

waiting/video library
o update Video library to use the new layout
o Export to Application not working with the current video library
o   https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/188

4.0 / with Casey
_ what things do we want to call out for the release?
_   this is also the welcome screen
_ Welcome
_   better startup experience/something to really make it feel like 4
_   set a new preference for it (the old pref had .beta in the name)
_   just skip the welcome screen on Windows hidpi dipslays?
_   better to launch a web browser
_     also use id/ask for login to help understand community?
_   tell users about JavaFX, Movie Maker install, changing themes
_ final call on the About screen

new things
+ themes
+ naming
+ new Movie Maker that uses ffmpeg
+ Apple Silicon support
+ raspberry pi 32/64 support
+ Java 17/faster/more up to date
+ JavaFX now needs to be imported
+ sketch name detached

minor new things
+ ability to create truly portable versions/more options for school environments

old things
+ Examples window (Casey will pick 3-4)
* Reference, Discourse, Github, Wiki


4.0 / housekeeping
_ pass through the source to update licenses
_   add Processing Foundation as 2012-15
_   update license info to state gplv2 not v3
_   run through that online license checker
_ add warnings to the old wiki pages with links to the newer versions
o change the license from GPL
_   make notes about the decision in the FAQ


detach sketch names
_ remove checkbox for detaching sketch name
_   just do this manually, and Save As will reset the name
_   should this be a setting in the sketch itself?
_ really need to override the save dialog and add a checkbox there
_   or should this be on the rename for the main tab
_   and if it's different on 'save as' then it won't update it
_ better yet, is it on creating sketches, so it actually is a pref
_   i.e. 'new sketches use name Sketch.java' instead of name of sketch as main tab
_   that might be closer to where people are expecting it anyway
_   and combined w/ the rename checkbox on the main tab, that might do it
_ detach sketch name and folder name (use sketch.properties)
_   better for git, etc
_   single file thing is long gone
_   introduce the idea of 'scraps' (ala gist) that are just single page blobs


priorities/would like to fix (but not necessary for 4.0 final)
_ completion mode pop-up not following dark and light mode conventions
_ Remove “Disable HiDPI Scaling” preference on Windows?
_   document it in the troubleshooting doc, ask people to report
_   put it into the Preferences page?
_ adding a file to an untitled sketch should require a save
_ editor breakpoints out of the .pde files
_   really a drag for version control
_     https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5848
_   or at least avoid the multiple
_     https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/330
_ Cannot type quotes with an international keyboard on MacOS
_   fixed by turning on "Enable complex text input"
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/322
_ loadShape(), show a warning when using style instead of presentation attributes
_ apt package for easier rpi install (especially)
_ better means of understanding Library/Mode/Tool usage

_ Open Sketch Folder not working on Linux with java.awt.Desktop quirks
_   make the call on the launcher setting for Linux
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/247
_ Find in Reference disabled for various keywords (draw, for, if, catch, while)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5562
X   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5642 (closed)


priorities/teaching
_ ui scaling in the PDE is important for classes/seeing at a distance
_   some interface zoom now conflicting with the Java 9+ defaults
_   things look terrible (tiny fonts) on Windows, adjusting has weird effects
_   resolve in DefaultPlatform and Toolkit, disable ui in PreferencesFrame
_ proxy trouble with p5? since adding the system proxy?
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/3251/files

organize this mess
_ implement support for Java “modules” and clean up JavaFX-specific workarounds
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/212
_   modules and classpath ugh https://stackoverflow.com/a/46289257
_ also the Crusty2D renderer for use with macOS hack stuff
_   actually need separate alpha/1.5/2.x versions of this
_ errors inside setup() aren't coming through at all?
_   seen in Eclipse; have to turn on the debugger... same as #4703?
_ mode list does not update after changing sketchbook folder
_   already reported?
_ make "Could not get the settings folder" message more helpful
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5744
_   need to check the locations it'd be writing to, and see if available
_   then tell the user which folder to fix
_   already fairly close, the problem is that they get a "report this" dialog box
_   but the useful information is in the actual exception message
_ import suggestions box needs design review
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3407
_ show compiling/startup animation after clicking run
_   or maybe show an animation for starting up
_   rather than post-compile
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/136
_ when lib downloads (batik) go dead, fallback to download.processing.org
_   or for now, tell users how to do it manually
_   batik and ant have both broken the build when old versions were removed
_ save() and saveAs() need to be refactored
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3843
_ move Library to LibraryContribution and into contrib?
_ improve error message when creating a tab with the same name
_   right now it's generic, based on "a file exists"
_ don't allow users to create 'blah.java' when 'blah.pde' already in sketch
_ detect changes in case with libraries
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4507
_ modes are being loaded multiple times, which can cause trouble
_ jeditsyntax is a mess of old-style getModifiers()
_   would like to switch this over, but needs to be tested a lot
_ startup is so incredibly slow
X   the splash screen comes up fairly quickly, so what gives?
_   lots of EDT thread stuff, particularly with loading contribs
_   handleNew() taking 2-3s?

PDE - Processing Development Environment


PDE / Dialogs

_ option to suppress warning dialogs
_   starting with the one about modifying the sketch name for spaces
_   also the "some features will be disabled" with .java tabs
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/46
_ add "don't warn me about this" for sketch renaming
_   make sure renamed version doesn't exist already
_ prompt user before nuking applet or application folders
_   along with a "don't ask me later"


PDE / Compiler & Preprocessor

medium (bugs/features)
_ preprocessor throws error when calling color() on a PGraphics
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3762
_ omitting a semicolon shows the error on the line after it
_ npe if library is removed before compile
_   always check library folders to make sure they're still valid
_ with additional .pde files, don't allow static mode in front tab
_   e.g. no setup()/draw() block
_ don't allow "for (blah; blah; blah) ;"
_   or if (blah blah blah) ;
_   it's never useful. students can use { } if they want an empty block

low (features)
_ copy running code from /tmp/buildXXxxx on crash of p5
_   should probably make a way to save/recover code
_   make the buildXxxx folders relate to time/date?
_ link out to further documentation (e.g. AIOOBE, NPE)

low (common errors around reserved names/class naming)
_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class or primitive breaks sketch
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/196
_ don't allow people to override methods like paint()
_   make them final? just improve the error messages?
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1058
_ Processing chokes if a sketch defines a class with same name as the sketch
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/196
_ don't allow goofy case versions of reserved words
_   keypressed should maybe throw an error
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/44
_ "unexpected token" on anonymous instance of parameterized Comparator
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/533


PDE / Editor

_ 'recent' menu paths can get enormous
_ active editor not being set null
_   in Base.nextEditorLocation(), changed to "editors.size() == 0"
_   instead of (activeEditor == null), but that's papering over a problem
_   where the active editor is not being set null
_ renaming RGB (.pde) to Rgb.java says "a file named RGB.pde already exists"
_ improve update check message "a new release (1.0.1) is available"
_   be more descriptive, use a second line in latest.txt
_   maybe just include the full text of the update message there?
_ go through other sketch-opening menus to check for disappearing sketches
_ deal with isManagingFocus() warning in the editor src
_ strange NullPointerException problem prevents launch
_   some kind of NPE in handleOpenInternal and friends
_   appears to be a synchronization problem with the loading
_ blank sketch opened even if another opened by double-click
_   add a 150 ms or more lag before opening the untitled window
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218
_ editors opening up at the same time on load?
_   either synchronize the open (at a minimum)
_   or wait for mac handlers to register an open event
_   can also cause problems with opening multiple copies of same sketch
_ after fixing name of sketch, ensure sketch of that name does not exist
_ add auto-save to the editor
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/131
_ implement better method of showing curly brace closure
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/94
_ setModified() getting called on Windows (probably Linux) for key cmds


PDE / Completion

_ text overlapping in the code completion popup
_   appears to be a bug in the text width calculations in JLabel
_ applyMatrix() sometimes ... and sometimes not
_   apparently "overloaded" methods are show as methodName(...) until selected
_   but the actual behavior seems inconsistent at best


PDE / Editor Toolbar (Buttons)

_ run button issues (unconfirmed)
_   does it unhighlight after compile or runtime errors?
_   also when using draw() instead of loop()
_     applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_   check 'finished' via objectreference?
_ EditorToolbar has two TODO items for open menu handling


PDE / Export

_ make possible to embed java for all platforms
_   straightforward to download from adoptium
_ export application ubuntu -> windows not working (2.2.1)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2698
_   might be something with libraries (native or otherwise)
_ "error during export" message, but no error message contents come through
_   e.g. https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4792


PDE / Libraries

_ alternate handling of duplicate library conflicts
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/5126
_ Add a means to specify packages to import in library.properties
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2134


PDE / Examples

_ examples handling is less than ideal
_   examples not mentioned in warning dialog when installing
_   doesn't show in examples window for p5jsMode
_   the extra "Contributed Examples" subfolder is awkward
_   perhaps more important, examples need to specify their Mode
_     not ideal for Android since there's some crossover, but ok for Example sets
_     otherwise impossible to know how to populate the Examples window
_ several "Could not find a matching .properties file" with clocks pdex
_ examples window is per-Mode, but that doesn't seem helpful
_   just like sketchbook, you can open one from the other
_   or maybe just contribs show everywhere? hrm
_ make sure pdex/pdez files working, also on Windows
_   contrib examples are just too convoluted to double-click
_   folders inside folders, bleh
_   what Mode are they for?
_ pdez links for contribs, not just the .zip
_   fix the code so that the contribs manager will handle it
_   though that's bad for earlier contribs, hrm
_ document pdez and pdex files so that folks can use them
_ load examples from pdez files
_   250 example (folders), would cut ~8-900 files to just those 250
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/182
_ examples window sketches should load in proper environment
_   test for what happens:
_   if Java Mode is in front, and user double-clicks another Mode's entry
_ write build.xml file to automatically update the examples
_ when adding a new library, its examples aren't added to the list until restart


PDE / Manager (4.x notes)

_ remove dorky loading.gif (used in ContributionTab and UpdateContributionTab)
_   should be a better way to implement this
_ if no internet available, install buttons disabled, but not clear why broken
_ also if update check disabled, user isn't notified that contribs unavailable
_ currently no indication that contrib download failed
_   so the 'try again' won't show up; everything looks fine
_   (was this for the contrib listing? or an actual contrib?)
_ ContributionTab.updateContributionListing()
_   this one shouldn't be in a single tab
_   and it should include all contribs (method from Base to get in one swoop?)
_   this is also likely the cause of per-Mode weirdness
_ Base.setUpdatesAvailable() is called from half a dozen places!?
_ how to handle contrib manager download/retry/etc and showing progress
_ ListPanel.configureStatusColumnLabel() getting null DetailPanel objects
_   seems to be out of sync/unavailable data based on more recent contrib changes?
_ ManagerFrame.downloadAndUpdateContributionListing()
_   should not even be run, because the contribs load on startup
_   but ContributionTab.tryAgainButton needs to be able to request re-download
_ ManagerFrame.makeAndShowTab()
_   this one looks like it's gonna get called multiple times
_ holy s*t ContributionTableModel is using all of the contribs
_ after failed update of Mode, the button is no longer available
_   have to click something else, then click back on the Mode line again
_ when starting in p5jsMode, contrib manager shows no green checks for libs
_   tricky because those aren't gonna show up in 'Add Library'
_   which is another case for a separate 'contrib manager' thing
_     maybe that's the update button? when no updates, it's still a button?
_ after opening Editor window, Processing freezes until contribs are loaded
_ when opening manager, animation runs briefly then freezes
_ DetailPanel setContribution() being called 4x for each contrib on startup
_ during install of contrib, progress is halting during the install
_   probably too much happening on the EDT that should not be
_ optimize ContributionTab addListener() call in constructor
X   no longer calling addListener() on every single entry, whcih helps
_   but what else might that change be breaking?
_ StatusPanel seems to be recreated entirely
_ StatusPanel being reset twice on each click
_   is checking for previous, but apparently that's not working
_ AvailableContribution.install() needs status handler
_   can either be the StatusPanel *or* EditorStatus *or* console (during startup)
_   needs to be EditorStatus when double-clicking a .pdex file
_   this is also why Base.handleOpen() does statusError() calls during pdex load
_ add indicator for the stats of libraries
_   https://download.processing.org/stats
_   add rank for libraries/modes/tools (use unicode chars?)
_   probably not sort by default to avoid confusion
_ lots of rewriting to use SwingWorker
_   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/worker.html
_   obvious places where this needs to happen, but the code is working for now
_   needs a few hours work to untangle all of it, but worth the regressions?
_ get rid of IgnorableException
_ contrib/mode/lib/example List objects in Base
_   which of these should be Set objects?
_ JProgressBar in StatusPanel is shared by all installing contribs
_   which could make for weird behavior if installs before something has finished
_   work to prevent multiple from colliding
_   (i.e. get rid of ContribProgress class)
X disable hashCode() implementation in Contribution
X   was getting in the way of comparisons
_   but need to compare the entries differently so there aren't dupes
_   i.e. it was doing a name comparison, so need to swap by name
_ after library/tool changes, rebuild Help > Library/Tool Reference submenus
_ could not write to temporary directory (virus checker problems)
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4757


PDE / Manager (3.x notes)

_ Fix vertical placement of top elements in the Manager window
_   https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/520
_   vertical centering of the search box in the manager
_ “could not move the contribution to the backup folder” message while updating
_   problem is that any sketch that uses a library, the lib is stuck as "in use"
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4973
_ issues with updating modes
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5424
_ examples window not updating on install
_   open examples window
_   mode > add mode > libraries > install video
_   did not update the examples window, had to restart pde
_ was able to save over the video capture examples b/c they were a library
_   lib examples not properly marked as read-only
_ "Could not find a examples in the downloaded file" is a poorly worded message
_ 'version' should be x.y or x.y.z, not some extra long string
_   enforce this by disallowing spaces? on the import script?
_ Progress bar height on macOS is too thin
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4734
_ proper error handling when downloading contribs listing
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4732
_ update CM entries when sketchbook location changes
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3927
_ ugly white gap at the top of scroll bar
_   the table header doesn't extend far enough
_ scrolling "past" top/bottom causes the screen to jiggle (OS X and Trackpad)
_   looks like ContributionListing.getScrollableUnitIncrement() returns early
_ Examples window closes and re-opens during library install/remove
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3304
_ several TODO items listed in ContributionPanel
_ something to set min/max versions that are supported by a library
_ ability to cancel a download/install
_ we shouldn't use .properties extension for modes, et al
_   because a .properties file is iso8859-1
_ make note that .properties file *must* be utf-8
_   if not it'll make things gross (andre sier flob library)
_ why wasn't Library moved to LibraryContribution?
_   or that LibraryContribution needs to be a wrapper around it?
_ send info on 'check for updates' so we know about libs/modes/etc?
_   how to disclose to users?
_   only send for items that are part of the public list
_     otherwise we're sending private libraries/installs
_     although this won't pick up old libraries not on the new system
_ classpath conflicts..
_   getPackageList.. from Library... maybe others?
_   really need to make sure that a weird core.jar isn't being imported
_   coffeescript was doing this and breaking the pde
_ contrib library examples are not read-only
_   another point for doing .zip files to prevent overwriting
_ add BookContribution?
_ will offer to open the contrib manager even though it's already open
_   though this was looking at libraries, and there may have been modes
_   is there an "all" view for the mgr that shows libs, modes, etc?
_ update button only showing up when item is selected feels awkward
_ "update all" would be useful
_   "Update 4 items" as a button name
_ new libraries not picked up when changing sketchbook location
_ make sure contrib manager can run w/o a network connection
_   or if a bad document comes through, it can recover
_ alternating blue/white backgrounds aren't updated after changing filter
_   just need to call a repaint() after a filter change?
_ check with Casey about coloring for error messages
_ test on Windows and Linux
_ font size for "Downloading" on progress bar is too large
_   but changing the size breaks the vertical centering
_ wheel mouse is super jumpy
_   something about unit increment in ContributionListPanel
_ arrow keys up/down move scroll bar, not selection
_ fonts/etc need to be set in one place where they can be edited
_   move styling to separate constants that are more accessible


PDE / Preferences

_ need to do the Mode prefs separately
_   since we can't have per-Mode constants (the pref names) in PreferencesFrame
_ Editor.applyFrame() may not have a valid 'editor' object to work with
_   if windows closed, and prefs altered, NPE thrown
_   make sure editor isn't trying to apply prefs when no editor is open
_   (on mac os x, due to the change for no windows open)
_ clear up prefs so that multiple editors don't trash each other's prefs
_   when are prefs saved? could instead save whenever changes are made
_   and then if the file gets modified, it'll put up an error message
_   also, this may be part of why other sketches aren't reloading properly
_ simple prefs implementation to set key/value pairs using a JTable
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5425
_ prefs window doesn't swap ok/cancel properly for mac vs. windows/linux
_   don't bother having a "cancel" for the prefs window
_ make prefs dialog modal?


PDE / Runner

_ if RuntimeException thrown, needs to check if it's a wrapped exception
_   for instance, if there's a crash inside makeGraphics()
_   this inside the handling that comes from the JVM, which makes it tricky
_ draw mode apps do not shut off the run button when finished
_   need to talk to VM and read when 'finished' var is set
_ does closing the window call stop()?
_   need to make sure hitting stop button and closing window explicitly call
_   set finished to true, then join() the animation thread
_ dispose handlers not called when stop button pressed
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4445
_ need to set dock icon title on osx
_ changing number of screens between run causes things to show up off-screen
_   so when running, check to make sure that things are out of the area


PDE / Debug

_ mouse events (i.e. toggle breakpoint) seem to be firing twice
_   wonder if this is mousePressed and mouseClicked?
_   this may also be the cause of the double entries in files
_ fix background color for selected lines in VariableInspector
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/3925
_ deactivate step, continue, stop when not running?
_ disable the debug toggle menu while running
_   otherwise could run in one mode, then try to stop in another


PDE / Multiple Monitors

_ changing modes brings the PDE back on the second screen
_   the Find window (also the save windows) also have the same problem


PDE / Tweak

_ TweakMode listener mess in JavaTextArea
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/4605


PDE / Sketch & Sketchbook

_ Saving sketch with the same name as a class
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/pull/4033
_ fix up the code for sketchbook building
_   is it time to make the internal representation into a tree object
_   and then build the GUI versions separately (on the EDT)
_ Base.checkSketchFolder() is used to identify sketches for the sketchbook frame
_   but it assumes that it's folder name + default extension as the name for it
_   that should be moved into the Mode class as a "is this folder a sketch" call
_   (so that Modes can work differently too)
_ Mode.rebuildLibraryList() called too many times on startup?
_   and when sketches saved as well?
_   makes saving *really* slow with a lot of libraries
_ New/Rename/Save As is reloading the whole sketchbook, argh
_ improve start time by populating sketchbook/libraries on threads
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2945
_ Large number of files in sketchbook folder can cause slow startup
_   and/or errors with launch4j
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1190
_ error that sketch is read-only can't be canceled
_   hitting cancel (or ESC?) still brings up the save dialog
_ ArticulatePrint-070103a.pde from ArticulatePrint-070103a loads ok
_   but when opening the sketch, it leaves out the file
_   because there's a dash in the name
_   and instead only loads StemCell.pde
_ show progress dialog during export and save
_ hitting ESC on "create this, move file, continue" opened anyway


PDE / Commander

_ command line complaints
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/6129
_ emacs style errors in commander aren't quite right
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2158
_ better command line support/basic language server support?
_   make it easier to use with other editors

TOOLS / Movie Maker

_ downloader for ffmpeg instead of including in download
_   would save ~20-25 MB in the download
_   should prompt the user before starting the download (not nice to use bandwidth)
_   need to disable creation of movies until the download has finished
_   handle failed downloads as well
_   make sure there are no signing problems on macOS after downloading


TOOLS / Ideas

_ eclipse import/export
_   simple mechanism to export to eclipse
_     don't worry about subversion stuff, just export with libraries
_   something clever to import back from eclipse
_   could keep the .svn files in with the libs and all
_   then when exporting for eclipse, people can update as necessary
_   -> dan et al say better to do fixed versions and have it work simply
_ import sketch from url (takes a zip from archive sketch)
_ archive sketch direct to bug report
_ shared code
_   Integrator / FloatThing / CameraStuff -- Update
_   to pull code from a local folder
_   update will update classes from shared in the current folder


TOOLS / Auto Format

_ Reas: comments go nasty when auto-formatted
_ Switch block cases not indented
_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1042
_ do a better job of maintaining cursor
_ only auto-format a particular section of code
_   set the 'tabs' var based on how many spaces on previous line
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Proce55ing_Software;action=display;num=1087227217


LIBRARIES / General

_ need to unpack InvocationTargetException in xxxxxxEvent calls
_   http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=VideoCamera;action=display;num=1116850328#3
_ go through libraries and clean things up
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
  try {
    close();
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // do something
  } finally {
    super.finalize();
    // more code can be written here as per need of application
  }
}


LIBRARIES / Net

_ modernize Client/Server code to use synchronized lists
_   do we let people use the public vars in Server and Client?
_   are they documented?


MODES / Python 2

X add JavaFX handler
X opening an example throws an NPE
_ update Export to Application to use the new window
_ add changes for the eawt mess? (too tricky)
_   https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/398

_ stop() to shut down a sketch (but not quit/close window)
_   actually pause/resume
_ MIN_FLOAT, MAX_FLOAT, also the difference from the Java functions
_   also MIN_INT and MAX_INT, even though those are more similar
_ update the reference to cover parseXxxx() stuff
_   also add notes about parseInt/Float(blah, otherwise)
_ also parseInt and parseFloat, how they can return another number or NaN
_   should the default be NaN or 0?
_ get/set are faster way draw screen space images, but no tint, no translations
_ make sure the docs include "beginShape() cannot be nested"
_   also add error messages to the renderers
_   also note that ellipse() et al use beginShape()
_   and that java2d should complain if people try it
_ method to go from function name to the included examples where used?
_ encourage use of set() instead of point() in the drawing api
_   https://forum.processing.org/beta/num_1114204116.html
_ noLoop() isn't the same as "finished", though it's sometimes used that way
_   to finish, use exit() (though that will make the window close)
_   add this to ref once halt() is finished
_ errors in pdf/index.html examples
_   probably remove these, move the useful ones to the examples folder
_   that way people will read the reference
_ explanation of how we see libraries in the PDE
_   We're making an assumption that the idea of a "library" refers to a block of Java-based code. The reasoning is that from within the PDE, we anticipate that it will be Java-compatible versions of other languages (such as Jython, JRuby, or Scala) as opposed to more generic languages. In the future we could open this up, but we'd rather not complicate things for the moment.

DOC / Text

_ how to use textMode(SHAPE) with opengl
_   things will be extremely slow (fix later)
_   things will also be very ugly on-screen
_ text being nicer in java2d
_   use createFont() to load the font or use a font from your machine
_   note that createFont() is no good for applets/export to web
_ textMode(SCREEN) for P2D and P3D for nice fast text in screen space
_   currently slow in JAVA2D and OPENGL, but this will improve
_ what is the vlw font file format?
_ shapes from 3D type
_   the way to do it (will improve later) is to use some undocumented features
_   1) you have to use the OPENGL renderer
_   2) use textMode(SHAPE);
_   3) use createFont() (which you already are)
_   this will convert all the shape data from the fonts for writing.
_   it will be *extremely* slow, which is part of why it's not documented yet.
_   but it will work with beginRaw().
_ improve documentation of the pdf stuff
_   be clearer about the font setup stuff
_   fonts by default not working that well?
