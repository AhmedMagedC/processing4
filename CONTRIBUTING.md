## Welcome to Processing!

### Bug Report?

We have a page on [troubleshooting](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Troubleshooting) common problems. Check there first!

We also host an [online forum](https://discourse.processing.org/) for coding questions, which is also helpful for general “getting started” queries.

If you don't find an answer, please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues). We can only fix the things we've heard about!

Also, please keep the tone polite. This project is volunteer work done in our free time. We give it away at no cost. We do this because we think it’s important for the community, and enjoy working on it. Complaints that things *suck*, or are *annoying*, or lectures about things that *must* be fixed are… weird to hear from total strangers (at best), and demotivating (at worst).

### Want to Help?

Great! The number of contributors on this project is *tiny*, especially relative to the number of users. There are [only one or two people](https://github.com/processing/processing4/graphs/contributors) who actively work on this repository, for instance. We need help!

How to start:

* Most [issues marked help wanted](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are a good place to start, because they are usually isolated enough that someone can jump into it without significant reworking of other code. 
* There are several [active issues](https://github.com/processing/processing4-javafx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for the JavaFX renderer as well.
* There are also many “help wanted” [issues in the 3.x repository](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Some of these are very old, so it may be a good idea to check in about the priority before putting in too much work!
* Keep the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) in mind when submitting pull requests. If you don't, someone else will have to reformat your code so that it fits everything else (or we'll have to reject it if it'll take us too long to clean it up).

If you're looking for a larger project, check out the [Project List](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List#processing) for other ideas.

### Other Details

This document was hastily thrown together in an attempt to improve the bug reporting process. It needs more detail about our intent with the project, the community behind it, our values, and an explanation of how the code itself is designed.
